    <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
    A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. </td></tr>

<tr class="cell0"><td>
    <h4>How do we use cookies?</h4>
    Blargboard uses a cookie to manage your login session. It stores a random, 16-character-long alphanumeric string in your browser to ensure that your login session will be connected to your browser only, and not to anyone else's.
    These are the only cookies our site uses.</td></tr>

    <h4>How to control cookies</h4>
    You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see <a href="http://aboutcookies.org/">aboutcookies.org</a>. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

        By registering a user account, you will be able to post on the board as well as use several features only accessible through registering, such as the ability to mark forums as read and private messaging. Unregistered users have guest access to the board, meaning they can view threads but not reply to them. They can also only see the board in whatever theme is the default.

<tr class="cell0"><td>
        Spam is making:<br><br>

- A post that is off-topic, meaning that it has nothing to do with the original thread. <br>
- A post that is only a few words long and doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the discussion.<br>
- A thread that doesn't have any real meaning.<br>
- A thread with a poll that is pointless.<br>
- A thread that is an exact duplicate of a pre-existing, recent thread.<br><br>
If you feel that a thread is spam, then PM an admin and ask them to take a look at it. Don't lecture the poster on the dangers of spamming.

<tr class="header1"><th>
        What can I do about my thread being either closed, trashed, or deleted?</th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
        First off, don't complain about this issue on the board about a thread being closed or deleted, and don't single out a certain mod or admin as being responsible. This will result in a ban. Learn from your mistakes and move on.<br><br>

If you feel you need clarification on why the thread was closed, or if you feel a mistake was made, contact a staff member, preferably a local moderator who's in charge of the relevant forum, and politely explain the problem.

<tr class="header1"><th>
        <h4>Help! I've been banned! What do I do now?</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell1"><td>
        First off, do not create a new account to complain about your ban, as that will just result in a permanent ban from the board.<br><br>

Check your title, it should mention why you are banned and an expiration date if the ban is temporary.<br><br>

If you feel that the ban was unfair or if you wish to know exactly why you were banned, PM an admin and calmly ask about it.<br><br>

Aside from that, the only thing you can do is wait for the ban to expire and make sure you know why it happened. If there is no expiration date, you are most likely banned until further notice, which means that you will have to prove that you have learned your lesson before you can be allowed back.

    <h4>Can I register more than one account?</h4></th></tr>

No, you may not. Most uses for a secondary account tend to be to bypass bans. The the most common non-malicious use is to have a different name, and we have another feature will allow this cleanly. This feature is called Display Names.

    <h4>How do I get a custom title?</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
Custom titles are titles you can use in addition to, or in place of the ranks provided by the board. There are three ways to get them:<br><br>

1. After 100 posts, or if you have been around 2 months you will need 50.<br>
2. Being a member of staff.<br><br>

The custom title is a reward for being an active member of the community. Use of the custom title to impersonate staff, or to flame members/staff may result in the loss of custom title.

        <h4>How do I edit a poll I made?</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell1"><td>
You don't. Poll editing is rather difficult to correctly implement and carries a risk of gross abuse. Imagine if you will, that you make a poll about something, and you don't like the results. With poll editing, you could then go and switch the answers around.

<tr class="cell0"><td>
If us administrators trust you enough for this. Don't ask us, we may ask you if we ever feel you worthy of being promoted. Being a good and regular member helps, while asking for this doesn't. It also depends whether we feel a need to promote more people, which isn't so often the case.

You can do it the standard way. Make derp posts and/or break the rules. <br><br>

But it's too mainstream. <br><br>

It will get you banned, but not immediately. You'll likely get a series of warnings before the staff actually starts banning you. <br><br>

<tr class="header0"><th>
        <h4>Intolerance</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
If you show off racism, homophobia or any other form of intolerance, you'll get banned pretty fast, and likely permanently. <br><br>

Intolerance is the number one cause of war and lots of other showoffs of complete stupidity in the world. </td></tr>
<tr class="header0"><th><h4>Constantly questioning the authority</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell1"><td>
        This board isn't a dictatorship, the staff is always open to criticism about the actions taken. <br><br>

Questioning the authority is OK if done in a constructive manner. Constantly doing it with silly arguments and running into the admins, however, is a good way to get yourself banned. </td></tr>
<tr class="header0"><th>
        <h4>Pissing off the staff</h4></th></tr>
<tr class="cell0"><td>
        Bad things can happen if you piss off the staff (in special owners). But generally annoying people who are hierarchically superior to you is a good way to get banned.</td></tr>
<tr class="header0"><th>
        <h4>Teaming up with banned users</h4></th></tr>

Banned users are banned for a reason. Teaming up with them and trying to rebel against authority is a good way to get yourself banned as well. </td></tr>

<tr class="cell0"><td><strong>Do not spam, troll, flame, harass, bash, etc.</strong><br>Blatantly offensive comments or actions directed at others will not be tolerated. While we do allow members to debate and voice their own opinions, there will be a limit to how far a heated debate can go before it is closed by staff. If you harass someone you will be disciplined. <br><br>

Please show respect for all members at Mario Making Mods; new or old. Disparaging remarks towards others about race, gender, origin, handicap, age, sexual orientation, personal politics and religion will NOT be tolerated and will most likely be removed by staff. The poster will then be warned or banned (see the Warnings section below for more information on warnings).<br><br>

Flaming, even in self-defense, is strictly prohibited. If you have something to say, say it respectfully or not at all. If someone is harassing you either use the report function or contact a staff member directly. Replying to a flame post will likely result in the removal of your post as well. Flambaiting, or attempting to draw other members into personally attacking you or eachother is also not allowed.</td></tr>

Do this twice, and you will be warned.</td></tr>

<tr class="cell0"><td><strong>Do not respond to spam, trolling, flaming, harassment, bashing, etc.</strong><br>
The reason is that the staff then has to delete your post as well, and it wastes our time. Instead, report the offending post with the "Report" button in its top-right corner.</td></tr>

<tr class="cell1"><td><strong>If one of your posts is removed don't repost it without staff permission.</strong><br>

<tr class="cell1"><td><strong>Do not bump old threads without a good reason.</strong><br>
"I'm having the same problem but none of the answers above have helped" or "Here's some new information about this" are good reasons to bump a thread. "Thanks for posting this" or "bump" are not.</td></tr>
